@title{Interactive Brokers API}
@author{evdubs}

Racket implementation for the @link["https://ibkrcampus.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/"]{Interactive Brokers' Trader Workstation Client API}.

This implementation is based on the Java TWS API version 10.30.01. The protocol used to communicate between the client and server establishes
 the client version and should allow the server to continue consuming and producing messages compatible with our version even when the server
 is updated. However, when there are desirable new features added, this library may be updated and its version number updated to reflect
 the version of the TWS API the new code uses.

The overall design of this library is to use objects to represent the connection and request messages and to use structs to represent
 response messages. Using objects for the connection and request messages seemed to make the process of creation easier as there are many
 fields that are often not cared about and can be omitted. We also use an interface and a base class for request messages. For response
 message, we stick to structs as we don't care about inheritance, nor do we need an ease-of-use creation method as the library creates
 the fully-filled-in instances. This is maybe a weird design.

With the release of Debian Trixie in early August 2025, it was noticed that older timezones like "US/Eastern" were no longer supplied
 in the default operating system `zoneinfo` files, even though IBKR uses them. If you have errors like:

"Unable to match pattern [VV] against input "US/Eastern" [,bt for context]"

then you may need to install a package like `tzdata-legacy` for these older timezones.

@section{Establishing a connection}

@defmodule[interactive-brokers-api]

The general code flow to establish a (default) connection and send a message is as follows:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
 (define ibkr (new ibkr-session%))
 (send ibkr connect)
 ;; The connection should be established after call to connect
 ;; Doing the below may be useful for testing
 (require interactive-brokers-api/request-messages)
 (send ibkr send-msg (new executions-req%))
)

@(require (for-label "base-structs.rkt"
                     "request-messages.rkt"
                     "response-messages.rkt"))

@defclass[ibkr-session% object% ()]{

This object is responsible for establishing a connection, sending messages, and registering callbacks to receive messages. One
 quirk of this implementation is that calls to @racket[send-msg] will block until we receive a response. During testing, it was
 seen that attempting to send multiple requests without waiting for a response forced a disconnect.

On construction, we attempt to connect to the TWS server from the specified @racket[hostname] and @racket[port-no]. Encryption is
 not used currently; this library is not recommended to be used over an unsecure network.

All response handlers will execute in the same, separate thread from the thread that constructs @racket[ibkr-session%].

The @racket[write-messages] field, when set to @racket[#t], will @racket[write] both request and response messages to the
 @racket[current-output-port].

}

@defmethod[(connect) void?]{

When called, a @racket[thread] is created to read from the socket and call the appropriate response handler with the received message.
 Currently, this thread will die when the connection is interruped. When this happens, I just create a new @racket[ibkr-session%] to
 connect again rather than attempt to call @racket[connect] on the existing session.
 
}

@defmethod[(send-msg [msg (is-a?/c req-msg<%>)]) void?]{}

Sends a message over the established session. See the @racket[request-messages] section for information on available request messages.

}

@section{Request messages}

@defmodule[interactive-brokers-api/request-messages]

@subsection{Base interface and class}

@definterface[req-msg<%> ()]{

This interface makes sure all request messages provide a @racket[->string] method that can be used to serialize the object into a
 string that can be processed by the server.

@defmethod[(->string) string?]{}

}

@defclass[ibkr-msg% object% ()]{

This is the base class for all request messages. There is no need for a client of this library to instantiate this class. This
 class is just a declaration that each request message will contain a @racket[msg-id] and @racket[version].

@defconstructor[([msg-id integer?]
                 [version integer?])]{}

}

@subsection{Account Data}

@defclass[account-data-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to receive @racket[account-value-rsp]s and @racket[portfolio-value-rsp]s. Each component of an account (e.g Net
 Liquidation, Account Code, Cash Balance, etc.) will be received in an individual response; there is no large structure or map
 that will be returned that has all of the account components. Likewise for the components of a portfolio. If you wish to aggregate
 the account and portfolio components, you will need to do that in your own application code. To receive account data, do:

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg (new account-data-req% [subscribe #t]))
]

By default @racket[subscribe] is @racket[#f]. To actually subscribe to data, you will need to set this value to @racket[#t]. When
 you are finished consuming account data, you can do the following to unsubscribe:

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg (new account-data-req% [subscribe #f]))
]

@defconstructor[([subscribe boolean? #f]
                 [account-code string? ""])]

}

@subsection{Contract Details}

@defclass[contract-details-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to receive a @racket[contract-details-rsp]. Here, if there is any ambiguity in your request, you will receive all of
 the contract details that match your request. As an example,

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg
      (new contract-details-req% [symbol "AAPL"]
                                 [security-type 'opt]
				 [strike 200.0]))
]

will retrieve all actively trading AAPL options with a strike price of 200.0. By filling in more fields in your request, you are more
 likely to retrieve a single result if that is your objective.

@defconstructor[([request-id integer? 0]
                 [contract-id integer? 0]
                 [symbol string? ""]
                 [security-type (or/c 'stk 'opt 'fut 'cash 'bond 'cfd
		 		      'fop 'war 'iopt 'fwd 'bag 'ind
				      'bill 'fund 'fixed 'slb 'news 'cmdty
				      'bsk 'icu 'ics #f) #f]
                 [expiry (or/c date? #f) #f]
		 [strike rational? 0]
		 [right (or/c 'call 'put #f) #f]
		 [multiplier (or/c rational? #f) #f]
		 [exchange string? ""]
		 [primary-exchange string? ""]
		 [currency string? ""]
		 [local-symbol string? ""]
		 [trading-class string? ""]
                 [security-id-type (or/c 'cusip 'sedol 'isin 'ric #f) #f]
                 [security-id string? ""]
                 [issuer-id string? ""])]{}

}

@subsection{Executions (otherwise known as trades)}

@defclass[executions-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to receive @racket[execution-rsp]s. As an example,

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg (new executions-req%
                         [timestamp (-period (now/moment) (days 7))]))
]

will retrieve all executions within a week.

@defconstructor[([request-id integer? 0]
                 [client-id integer? 0]
                 [account string? ""]
                 [timestamp (or/c moment? #f) #f]
                 [symbol string? ""]
                 [security-type (or/c 'stk 'opt 'fut 'cash 'bond 'cfd
		 		      'fop 'war 'iopt 'fwd 'bag 'ind
				      'bill 'fund 'fixed 'slb 'news 'cmdty
				      'bsk 'icu 'ics #f) #f]
                 [exchange string? ""]
                 [side (or/c 'buy 'sell 'sshort #f) #f])]{}

}

@subsection{Historical Data}

@defclass[historical-data-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to receive @racket[historical-data-rsp]s. The interesting part of this response are the @racket[bar]s
 that are sent back and can be used for display in a chart. As an example,

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg (new historical-data-req%
                         [request-id 22]
                         [symbol "UPS"]
			 [security-type 'stk]
			 [exchange "SMART"]))
]

will retrieve 1-hour (@racket[bar-size] default) open-high-low-close bars from yesterday to today
 (@racket[end-moment] and @racket[duration] defaults) representing trades (@racket[what-to-show] default).

As of 2020-09-03, the smallest set of data at the finest resolution is to request 1-second bars over a duration of 30
 seconds.

You will need to track the relationship between your request-id and your parameters as the returned @racket[historical-data-rsp]s
 will not have the symbol, security-type, etc. information.

@defconstructor[([request-id integer? 0]
                 [contract-id integer? 0]

@defclass[cancel-historical-data-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to stop receiving @racket[historical-data-rsp]s.

@defconstructor[([request-id integer? 0])]{}

}

@subsection{Market Data}

@defclass[market-data-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to receive streaming @racket[market-data-rsp]s. As an example,

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg (new market-data-req%
                         [request-id 23]
                         [symbol "UPS"]
			 [security-type 'stk]
			 [exchange "SMART"]))
]

will subscribe to (at least) bid/ask price and size updates.

You will need to track the relationship between your request-id and your parameters as the returned @racket[market-data-rsp]s
 will not have the symbol, security-type, etc. information.

When requesting market data for an option, you will also receive @racket[option-market-data-rsp]s.

See @racket[generic-tick-requests] for the symbols to use for @racket[generic-tick-list].

@defconstructor[([request-id integer? 0]

}

@defclass[cancel-market-data-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to stop receiving @racket[market-data-rsp]s.

@defconstructor[([request-id integer? 0])]{}

}

@defclass[market-data-type-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to change the type of market data received using calls to @racket[market-data-req%].
As an example,

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg (new market-data-type-req%
                         [market-data-type 'delayed-frozen]))
]

will allow subsequent @racket[market-data-req%] calls to first retrieve real-time market data if available;
if not, delayed market data will be retrieved; if delayed data is unavailable, delayed frozen
(last available market data) data will be retrieved.

Using @racket[market-data-type-req%] is useful when subscribing to market data using a demo account where
real-time data may not be supported.

@defconstructor[([market-data-type (or/c 'real-time 'frozen 'delayed 'delayed-frozen)
                                   'real-time])]{}

}

@subsection{Orders}

@defclass[open-orders-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to receive all @racket[open-order-rsp]s. There are no fields to provide here to filter for particular
 open orders.

@defconstructor[()]{}

}

@defclass[place-order-req% ibkr-msg% (req-msg<%>)]{

Request message to place an order. As you can see below, there are tons of different fields to produce an order that is
 as complex as you desire. Certain fields might interfere with others or be required by others. Despite this class'
 many fields, it is likely that you will just be doing something simple like the following:

@racketblock[
(send ibkr send-msg
      (new place-order-req% [symbol "AAPL"]
                            [security-type 'stk]
			    [exchange "SMART"]
			    [currency "USD"]
			    [action 'buy]
			    [total-quantity 100]
			    [limit-price 200.0]))
]

Any questions related to which fields do what should first consult the IBKR docs or IBKR themselves. The fields of this
 class are intended to exactly match those in the Java client library.

Be sure to add a handler for @racket[next-valid-id-rsp] in @racket[ibkr-session%] so that you don't run into any errors
 as a result of reusing an order ID. Order IDs are unique integers over the life of an account.

Please note that the fields @racket[action], @racket[order-type], @racket[time-in-force], @racket[open-close], and @racket[origin]
 use defaults that are not the @racket[#f], @racket[0], or @racket[""] typical defaults. Also note that you need to manage
 @racket[order-id] on your own. If you do not supply an @racket[order-id], it will use 0 and you will likely get an error stating
 the order ID has already been used. @racket[post-to-ats] has a default value of @racket[2147483647], which matches Java's
 Integer.MAX_VALUE. The API typically uses these MAX_VALUEs as defaults; they used to take care to make sure the values were not
 sent over the wire, but that is no longer the case with these additional fields.
